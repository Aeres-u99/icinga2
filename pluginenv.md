### Add LSD theme

The plugins can be reached on [this](https://exchange.icinga.com/) site. 

We will setup the [LSD](https://exchange.icinga.com/cark/LSD%20Theme) theme now. 

In order to setup this theme we need to issue the following commands.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Mikesch-mp/icingaweb2-theme-lsd /usr/share/icingaweb2/modules/lsd
icingacli module enable lsd
```

Now under the web interface "my account" you can select a custom theme.
